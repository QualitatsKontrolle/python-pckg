# üêç Python Projects Repository

Welcome to my Python Projects Repository! This repo is a collection of various Python projects, ranging from simple scripts to complex applications, created to explore, learn, and showcase different aspects of Python programming.

## üöÄ Project Overview

This repository includes different Python projects that demonstrate:

- Working with **data formats** like JSON and CSV
- **Web development** with frameworks such as **Django** and **Flask**
- **Bash scripting** for automation
- **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD pipelines

Each project is organized into its own folder, containing the code, resources, and a brief description to help you understand its purpose.

## üìö Projects Included

1. **Web Applications**: Developed using **Django** and **Flask**, showcasing CRUD operations, user management, and more.
2. **Data Processing**: Python scripts that handle **JSON** and **CSV** files, demonstrating data manipulation and analysis.
3. **Automation**: **Bash scripts** integrated with Python to automate repetitive tasks.
4. **CI/CD Experiments**: Simple workflows using **GitHub Actions** to streamline development processes.

## üí° Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language used for all projects.
- **Django & Flask**: Frameworks used for web development.
- **Bash Scripting**: For automating server and infrastructure tasks.
- **MySQL/PostgreSQL/SQLite**: Databases for data storage.
- **GitHub Actions**: Setting up CI/CD from scratch to automate testing and deployment.
